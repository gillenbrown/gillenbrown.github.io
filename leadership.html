					<p>
						I'm a member of the Michigan Dark Skies group [link], which
						raises public awareness of light pollution and advocates
						for dark sky friendly lighting at the local level. 
					</p>
					<p>
						I have been involved with several projects with Michigan Dark 
						Skies. I've met with the DEVELOPERS of an upcoming DEVELOPMENT
						in Ann Arbor to encourage lighting that reduces light pollution. 
						While the project is still in the early stages, the DEVELOPERS 
						have committed to use dark sky friendly light fixtures and 
						light bulbs.  
					</p>
					<p>
						I've also met with the ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL STUDENT ADVISORY 
						COUNCIL to discuss light pollution issues.
						This group is a branch of city council composed of students
						that [what do they do?]. Ann Arbor City Council is considering
						adding streetlights in areas with a lot of student housing. I 
						worked with this group to conduct a lighting audit of these areas, 
						and ensure that any additional streetlights added cause as little
						light pollution as possible.
					</p>
					<p>
						Lastly, I've engaged in outreach to educate the public about
						light pollution and how to stop it. I gave a talk at Ignite
						Ann Arbor, an event consisting of 5 minute talks with 20 slides
						that automatically advance every 15 seconds. I gave a quick overview
						of what causes light pollution, how we can reduce it, and why we 
						should care about it.

					<p>
						In March, I will give a talk at Ann Arbor Nerd Nite about the 
						chemical evolution of the universe. I'll walk through all the
						basic nucleosynthetic processes and what objects these processes 
						operate in. This will let me walk through the periodic table 
						and discuss where all the elements we know so well came from.
						This is a great story that doesn't get told much in science
						communication, and I think it deserves to be told more.
